# Dalitz plot fit using TensorFlowAnalysis

Example is available here: https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2/blob/master/demos/04_tfa_dalitz_fit.py

Now we will do some useful stuff: a real Dalitz plot fit. We will generate a sample of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D^{0}\to K_{S}^{0}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}"> decays according to a rather simple amplitude model with only 3 intermediate resonances, and then fit it back.
