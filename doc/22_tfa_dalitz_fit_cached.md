# Dalitz plot fit with caching, plotting fit results

Example is available here: https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2/blob/master/demos/05_tfa_dalitz_fit_cached.py

In this example, we will demonstrate an approach to the optimisation of calculations by caching certaing quantities which don't need to be recalculated at every step of minimisation. In addition, we will demonstrate plotting the projections of the fit result, including components of the fitted function. Otherwise, the problem that is solved by the script is the same: generation and fitting of the D0 -> Ks pi+ pi- decay.
