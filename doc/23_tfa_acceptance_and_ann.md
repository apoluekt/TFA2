# Acceptance profile of Bs->Jpsi phi decay and ANNs for its parametrisation 

This example is based on three scripts that run sequentially: 
   * https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2/blob/master/demos/06_tfa_fast_mc.py
   * https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2/blob/master/demos/07_tfa_ann_density_estimate.py
   * https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2/blob/master/demos/08_tfa_ann_density_use.py
   
Here we will demonstrate how one can use various kinematical functions of TFA: Lorentz boosts, rotations, _etc_.
